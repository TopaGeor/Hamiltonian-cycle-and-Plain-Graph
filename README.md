# Hamiltonian-cycle-and-Plain-Graph
An algorithm to check if a graph has a Hamiltonian cycle  and then if it is a plain graph.

The code is written in Python 3.7.6 and follows the pep8 standard. <br />
There is also a testing file for the functions. <br />
Files graph.txt and graph2.txt are graphs that has been use during the development. <br />
File testing_graph.txt is the graph that is been used for testing and thus should not been change. <br />
Files graph.txt and testing_graph.txt are the same, one for the algorithm and one for testing. <br />
In order for the algorithm to work the graph should be underacted and has no more than 26 vertexes. <br />
